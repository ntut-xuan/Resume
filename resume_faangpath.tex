\begin{rSection}{SELF-PROMOTION}
    I'm Huang, Han-Xuan, a backend developer with a strong foundation in Flask and an interest in learning new technologies to enhance my development skills. I have experience with how to design web applications and how to improve software quality with unit tests and CI checks. Eager to contribute to the team while also advancing my growth.

    In my experience, I usually use Flask to develop the web application and SQLAlchemy to interact with the database. For the application can running successfully, I implement some measures to make the project robust. For example, to confirm the application works smoothly, write the unit and integration tests and keep the project stable with code coverage of 85 percent or even higher. Furthermore, set up the GitHub Actions in the repository with MyPy and Docker hooks to check the static type and test whether the current version passed the test case and built the container successfully or not. 
    These measures implement successfully on my projects like NuOJ or Fastshop. With these actions, I can develop the function from debugging the code from 1-2 days to 1-2 hours and have more time to create the new feature, and it improves the development experience since the bug decreased significantly.

    As an intern, I would like to study how to develop a web application that considers the load issue and how to optimize the loads and distribute the load to multiple machines, learn how to implement Clean Code and Clean Architecture, and have an interest in understanding how to collaborate with teams with Scrum framework.

    Thanks for considering my application. I am looking forward to enhancing my ability and contributing to the team.
